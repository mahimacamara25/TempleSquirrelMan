To continue on from our video this game was very fun and a huge learning experience for the both of us. We faced some challenges along the way, minor bugs that were fixed and some that still exist. 
I would for sure continue on this project such as adding sounds when the squirrel eats the balls(which I tried but the squirrel sounded overly big), trying to get better characters and 
adding another level. I also want to try to explore coding on something other than idl because idl made it hard. I wasnt able to collaspe functions to make it more cleaner to code.
Another thing was our width and height is different from the tutorial so making that change had to make us overly aware of what numbers we use since the tutorial numbers wont 
fit in our new width and height size. Also, we have kate bush in the background inspired by stranger things you cant hear in the video but when you play you will. I hope you enjoy playing as much as we do!
Here is the link to the tutorial for the basics of the game : https://youtu.be/9H27CimgPsQ?si=TNDfFJhj4QzcmtQi
